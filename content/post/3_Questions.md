#### Ask yourself the following questions
* Is what I'm working on something that would benefit the wider development community?
* Do I feel comfortable that work I'm doing does not include trade secrets?
* Have you written the code as a pair, or have a code reviewer?
* Why are you still asking questions, push some code!
