### What's the point?
The readme is the first thing will people will see about your project.  This should provide an explanation for why it exists, and why anyone would care about it.

### What are my rights?
You also should include license information, so they understand how to use it.  Our default
license is [Apache 2](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)

### How can I help?
If you're open sourcing something, you are hopefully open to outside contributions.  Make sure your expectations and process are clearly laid out for people who want to help. You should tell them how to make the thing run and how to test it -- in simple, easy to follow steps.

### Does this thing even work?
A sign of a high quality project is well written tests, that are continuously run.  By having CI setup and publicly shown, visitors to your repo can have confidence in the code. This could include badges or a link to an example of the live application

### Is anyone maintaining this and/or what just changed?
As you update the project, you should provide semantic versioning to allow consumers to understand the types of changes made, and allow them to use the project with security.   You should include release notes that detail any important features or bug fixes, and specifics on any breaking changes.
