### What shouldn't be open sourced?
* Code that includes work that is licensed by someone else
* Work that provides a significant competetive advantage over other retailers
* Projects that are dependent on THD specific environment
    * This should be only true in rare cases
* Code that does not have CI or automated unit tests
    * Please don't do this, even if you aren't open sourcing
* Code that is essentially the same as other open source projects
    * Could you contribute to those projects instead?
